# Reading App
Allows you to track book reading progress and reading speed over time.

## How to run
1. Run `gradle build` to make sure depencies are compiled and project is setup correctly.
2. Run `gradle clean` to clean out the /build/ directory.
3. Run `gradle appStartWar` to run app on localhost:8080/reading-app/

## How to stop
1. Run `gradle appStop`

_Note: if running `gradle` does not work, try using an IDE like intellij or using `./gradlew` instead._

Example: `./gradlew appStartWar`
